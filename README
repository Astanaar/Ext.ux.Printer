Ext.ux.Printer is a small library that provides a generic way of printing Ext Components (Grids, Trees, etc).

Use it like this:

Ext.ux.Printer.print(someGrid);
Ext.ux.Printer.print(someTree);

Each of the above examines the component you pass to the print function, and if a suitable printer has been created
for it, the component is printed by opening a new window, writing some print-friendly HTML to it, and calling the 
window's print function.

Currently supported components are:

Ext.grid.GridPanel
Ext.tree.ColumnTreePanel

To add support for another Component type, simply subclass Ext.ux.Printer.BaseRenderer (see the existing renderers for examples),
and register it with Ext.ux.Printer.registerRenderer('somextype', Ext.ux.Printer.SomeComponentRenderer).
